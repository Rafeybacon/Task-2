Hello I have found that you are having a problem with your screen!
I have compiled some likely causes of the problem along with solutions to them,
hope this solves your problem!

***Problem One***

App causing screen to go blank

***Solution***

Turn the device off.
Press and hold the Power key.
release the Power key.
Immediately after releasing the Power key, press and hold the Volume down key.
Continue to hold the Volume down key until the device finishes restarting.
Safe mode will display in the bottom left corner of the screen.
Release the Volume down key when you see Safe Mode.

From here proceed to uninstall the new app that as it is likely the cause of the problem.
However if the problem presists then:

Turn off the device.
Press and hold the following three buttons at the same time: Volume Up key, Home key, and Power key.
When the phone vibrates, release the Power key but continue to press and hold the Volume Up key and the Home key.
When the System Recovery screen appears, release the Volume Up and Home keys.
Press the Volume down key several times key to highlight ‘wipe data / factory reset.’
Press Power button to select.
Press the Volume down key until ‘Yes — delete all user data’ is highlighted.
Press Power button to select and start the master reset.
When the master reset is complete, ‘Reboot system now’ is highlighted.
Press the Power key to restart the device.

***Problem Two***

Screen flickering

***Solution***

The flickering is likely caused by liquid that has managed to make its way inside,
the best thing to do is contact support and request to have it sent back for repairs
for if this is left to long then the internal components can become damaged further.

***Problem Three***

Screen is multicoloured and is unresponsive

***Solution***

The screen is broken. This is one example of a “bleeding” display. 
Try calling your phone and if it can receive it, then the problem is just with its display. 
Screen replacement is necessary to make it work again. 
If, however, it couldn’t receive your call, there might be another hardware issue. Either way you need a technician.
