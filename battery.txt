Hello I have found that you are having a problem with your battery.
I have compiled some likely causes of the problem along with solutions to them,
hope this solves your problem!

***Problem One***

Battery drains very quick

***Solution***

MAKE SURE TO BACK UP FILES BEFORE

turn off the device.
Press and hold the following three buttons at the same time: Volume Up key, Home key, and Power key.
When the phone vibrates, release the Power key but continue to press and hold the Volume Up key and the Home key.
When the System Recovery screen appears, release the Volume Up and Home keys.
Press the Volume Down key to highlight wipe cache partition.
Press the Power key to select.
When the wipe cache partition is complete, Reboot system now is highlighted.
Press the Power key to restart the device.

***Problem Two**

Battery is overheating

***Solution**

Don’t put your device in the place with too much heat, such as a car dashboard. Your car dashboard gets strong sunlight directly. 
If the weather is too hot outside and you find the device get hot as well, bring your device to the shade. 
Let it cool down a bit before you start using it again. 
No matter how hot the iPhone is, don’t put it in a refrigerator. Let the device cool gradually.

If the device gets hot while charging, then stop this straight away.
Observe what happens, if the issue stops then you need to try a different cable or plug.
However if this issue still continues then you'll need to contact support and have a new bettery sent to you as the old battery
is dying and so getting hot very quicky.

Third party accessories may cause some common issues on a device,
such as battery life problem and overheating issue. 
The design and material of the case can cause the problem. 
Remove the case and leave it like that until the phone cools down. 
Once your device cools down, you can use it again.
